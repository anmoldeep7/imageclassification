### About

DeepClassifyML is a webapp to classify images into different categories using a pre-trained model on the Imagenet dataset. ImageNet is a common academic data set in machine learning for training an image recognition system. The basic idea is to allow the user to upload an image from his/her system or through an url and run the Inception model over it to classify in different classes with a confidence(probability) score. The results would be something like this :
